""" main goals of EDA are generally:

    Uncover the data structure and determine how it is coded
    Inspect and “get to know” the data by summarizing and visualizing it
    Detect outliers, missing data, and other anomalies and decide how/whether to address these issues
    Find new avenues for analysis and further research
    Prepare for model building or analysis, including the following:
        Check assumptions
        Select features
        Choose an appropriate method
